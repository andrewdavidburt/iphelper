iphelper
IP enrichment function for AWS lambda
by Andrew Burt

to try:
curl https://ia3xx10f46.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/staging/iphelper?ip=1.1.1.1
(replace ip= with whatever IP you like)

uncompleted: terraform implementation, I spent much of Sunday on it, but terraform kept hanging on apply, due to some type of AWS timeout I couldn't diagnose in time.
